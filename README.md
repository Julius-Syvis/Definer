## Definer - quick definition lookup

### Latest version - 1.1

This extension was built to speed up definition lookup using the built-in Google dictionary. When this extension is installed, selecting some text in your browser enables you to click "Define" in the context menu, opening a new google search tab with `define <phrase>`. In other words, it's an alternative to [Google Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja).
